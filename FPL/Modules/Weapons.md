#HasComms #System  
Allows players to shoot, each missile must be manually loaded, and beams cannot be aimed, instead firing straight forwards out of the ship. Up to 2 players can be controlling the weapons at once

when aiming the weapons, you can engage a stabiliser on a target that stays within the viewport for 2s, this stabiliser stops either ships' movements from moving the camera, allowing the controller to target the weapons easily. Being shot or losing sight of the target will disable the stabiliser. You can lose sight if the weapons are not on the side of your ship that is facing the target.
