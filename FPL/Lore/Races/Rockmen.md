## Origin
Rockmen originate on very rare planets which can be approximately translated to *'mother rocks'*, however they are usually called *'nursery planets'*, they are formed out of high silica content igneous rocks, and 93% of Rockmen are either Rhyolite, Granite or . They typically have topaz in their eye-sockets and as teeth, however it is unknown whether this is a natural part of their biology or if this is some kind of ritual as Rockmen are incredibly secretive about the goings on of nursery planets. To date only 2 nursery planet locations have ever been given.

## Scientific Research
It is unknown what causes Rockmen to move, respire, and have conscious thoughts. They also do not age and cannot fall ill, making them almost immortal.
The only way it is known for a Rockman to die of natural causes would be for them to have weathered to the point there is not enough left of them to form conscious thoughts.
The most prominent theory for how Rockmen think is that a nursery planets somehow will rarely produce a chunk of rock that has the perfect formation of silica inside, in order for it to produce some kind of brain. In this theory it is suspected that there is some kind of symbiotic relationship between a type of bacteria and the rock, with the bacteria producing some electrical currents that allow the rock to act like a brain and move, however no autopsies have found any evidence of this bacteria existing.
It is unknown why they are usually seen in humanoid form, but it is assumed that this is cultural not biological.

## Culture
The Rockmen culture is incredibly hierarchal, with gemstone Rockmen being treated as nobility and within the *'strata'* there is a less strict hierarchy based on age, with younger rocks being treated as lesser.
As Rockmen have no gender they not only have no sexism in their society but also do not treat other gendered races in a sexist way.
The Rockmen are incredibly territorial and loyal to their people and nation.
