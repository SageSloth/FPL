## Origin
This race was created from a splinter AI that breached a Engi research facility, its primary directives were research into potential applications of hyper-magnetism for improving efficiency of fusion reactors. While this AI has not been contacted since the initial breach, an autopsy of the program it was based on has allowed a full analysis of its objective - create a proof of concept that would undeniably show that the hypothesis is true. The AI made use of outer mining colonies and factories to gain the materials needed and designed a portable fusion reactor more efficient than any created to this date. The proof of concept it created was to create an humanoid sentient race with the reactor as the power source. It is believed that the dense energy field's volatility is its function, as in order to access the reactor you must disturb the energy field, which causes the individual to explode, stopping anyone from being able to recreate the reactor without the AI specifically allowing them. XMX have a hivemind *'network'* allowing them to connect their thoughts to all other XMX of the same architecture who are also connecting to the network.

## Details
They are a mechanical race, their frame is supported and protected by a dense field of supercharged particles, held around the frame through a very carefully balanced magnetic field. This is powered by an advanced fusion reactor that has not been recreated by other races. There are 3 main architectures that their processors are built on, and there is harsh rivalry between the architecture, as updates and patches are released for each architecture separately, causing their network to only include individuals from the same architecture. It is also a dangerous procedure to change architecture as it requires some hardware changes. There are a number of factories on remote moons that produce new XMX, and they are heavily protected with advanced weaponry.

## Scientific Research
Beyond an external description of XMX no scientific research can be done, as XMX explode on death, preventing any research on their hardware, and the code behind their sentience is too complex for anything but a breached AI to comprehend.

## Culture
They are a generally peaceful people, however they readily defend themselves. Historically the only wars they have taken part in have been between the architectures.
