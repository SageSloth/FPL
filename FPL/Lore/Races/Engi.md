## Origin
The Engi are a peaceful robotic race, that originated from a race that is now long dead. When the star of their system expanded to a red giant the race that had colonised the system was wiped out as their was no longer any locations where food could be created. The manufacturers of the Engi had ensured that there was a case for if their race was wiped out, as it was deemed cruel to create an semi-conscious race of robots if they would cease to have purpose when their race died out eventually. They had set the Engi to be given full intelligence, with a new directive: Act as caretakers for the galaxy. Once the Engi gained full intelligence, they rapidly developed incredible technology, as the system contains large quantities of a number of very rare compounds.

## Details
The Engi are a robotic race, standing at 1.75m, their bipedal appearance was designed to mimic their creators, they have head, with a screen embedded in the top of their body, acting as a kind of face. They mainly use their 2 primary arms, but have a secondary pair that are completely retractable. When an Engi feels like they have learned enough in life to produce a new Engi that is improved, they will start the lengthy process of creating a new Engi, this being how they "reproduce"
