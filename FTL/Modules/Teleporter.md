Allows players to teleport onto the other ship, you can pick where to teleport based on a silhouette of the ship layout, players who have teleported must be returned by a member of crew. From the ship you can see the teleported teammates POV and their health but you cant hear them.
(The teleporter doesn't teleport any items)
