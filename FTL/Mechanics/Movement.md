## Modes

### NoGrav
Speed isn't capped so it can allow very fast traversal but you have to be careful to use railings well or else you will go in the wrong direction

### Gravity / Attached
Low Speed but easy, always attached to the floor and therefore no jump and sprinting does not have large impact. Large impacts to the ship can disable this and send you flying.
